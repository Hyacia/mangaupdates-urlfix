mangaupdates-urlfix
===================

Userscript that adds urls and irc link back on the groups pages of mangaupdates.com

##Installation
Standard version: ['mangaupdates_group.user.js'](https://github.com/loadletter/mangaupdates-urlfix/raw/master/mangaupdates_group.user.js)


Online version (Uses directly the data from github, should have the latest groups even if autoupdate isn't supported/working): ['mangaupdates_group_online.user.js'](https://github.com/loadletter/mangaupdates-urlfix/raw/master/mangaupdates_group_online.user.js)


### Firefox:

Make sure you have greasemonkey installed and just click on one of the previous links.

### Chrome/Chromium/Opera:

1. **Preferred** method: Install tampermonkey or equivalent and then just click on one of the previuos links.

2. Other (Could be used with the online version): Save the previous link to a file (Right click> Save link as..), then open the folder where you downloaded it and drag the file to the Extensions page on Chrome.

##Script not autoupdating?
- Check your greasemonkey/tampermonkey/etc settings or try using the online version.
- With the online version the groups are external, so the version number is lower than the standard version.

##(New) Missing/outdated/wrong links?
Just click (Suggest an update), and you will be able to send a new url that will be added in the next updates!
