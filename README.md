mangaupdates-urlfix
===================

Userscript that adds urls and irc link back on the groups pages of mangaupdates.com

##Installation
Link: ['mangaupdates_group.user.js'](https://github.com/loadletter/mangaupdates-urlfix/raw/master/mangaupdates_group.user.js)


### Firefox:

Make sure you have greasemonkey installed and just click on the previous link.

### Chrome/Chromium:

1. **Preferred** method: Install tampermonkey or equivalent and then just click on the previuos link.

2. Other (Doesn't autoupdate): Save the previous link to a file (Right click> Save link as..), then open the folder where you downloaded it and drag the file to the Extensions page on Chrome.

### Opera:

Apparently default opera doesn't autoupdate, so install tampermonkey and use that.


##Script not autoupdating on Opera/Chrome?
If you have installed the script directly you will need to uninstall it and reinstall it with tampermonkey (or equivalent).


##(New) Missing/outdated/wrong links?
Just click (Suggest an update), and you will be able to send a new url that will be added in the next updates!
