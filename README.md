mangaupdates-urlfix
===================

Userscript that adds website and IRC links on the groups pages of mangaupdates.com

It can also redirect directly to the website (toggle with link at the bottom of the [groups list](https://www.mangaupdates.com/groups.html))

or redirect the link to the latest chapter in the user's lists to its scanlator (toggle with link at the bottom of the [user lists](https://www.mangaupdates.com/mylist.html))


##Installation

Browsers usually need an addon to run userscripts, like:

- Firefox -> [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
- Chrome/Chromium -> [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- Opera -> [Violent monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/)
- Safari -> [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit)
- QupZilla -> Open the preferences window > Extensions > enable GreaseMonkey

Once one of those or similar is installed, click on the following link: ['mangaupdates-urlfix 1.7'](https://github.com/loadletter/mangaupdates-urlfix/raw/master/mangaupdates_urlfix.user.js)
