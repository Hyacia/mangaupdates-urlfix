mangaupdates-urlfix
===================

Userscript that adds urls and irc link back on the groups pages of mangaupdates.com

##Installation
(tl;dr online version is probably better for most people)
- Online version (Never outdated): ['mangaupdates_group_online.user.js'](https://github.com/loadletter/mangaupdates-urlfix/raw/master/mangaupdates_group_online.user.js)
- Standard version (Faster loading, unreliable update): ['mangaupdates_group.user.js'](https://github.com/loadletter/mangaupdates-urlfix/raw/master/mangaupdates_group.user.js)

### Firefox:

1. Make sure you have greasemonkey installed and just click on one of the previous links.

### Chrome/Chromium/Opera:

1. **Preferred** method: Install tampermonkey/violentmonkey or equivalent and then just click on one of the previuos links.

2. Save the online version link to a file (Right click> Save link as..), then open the folder where you downloaded it and drag the file to the Extensions page on Chrome.

##Script not autoupdating?
- Use the oline version or check your greasemonkey/tampermonkey/etc settings.
- With the online version the groups are external, so the version number is lower than the standard version.

##(New) Missing/outdated/wrong links?
Just click (Suggest an update), and you will be able to send a new url that will be added in the next updates!
